| **DOTFILES!!!** | I use Neovim btw ✨. I love writing code and I love tools. I want to dictate how stuff behaves so I have my own config for arch/nvim/git/tmux/zj/ghostty etc: [dotfiles writeup](https://cb341.dev/projects/dotfiles/) | <a href="https://cb341.dev/projects/dotfiles/"><img width="3438" height="2140" alt="CleanShot 2026-01-01 at 19 56 29@2x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09e6a801-c6a4-480d-8a67-dc7b895ac8ef" /></a> |
| **My Hello World Rust Project** | A multi threaded Client / Server Voxel Engine with custom perlin noise based terrain generation (mountains, caves, trees etc.), custom geometry generation as well as serealization and compression via serde and some knowledge aquired at the school of engineering. Find more info in the [rsmc repository](https://github.com/cb341/rsmc). I found some inspiration in my favourite game MINECRAFT. | <a href="https://github.com/cb341/rsmc"><img width="2388" height="1256" alt="CleanShot 2026-01-01 at 19 43 15@2x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8b3ad0c-3c37-4889-aee0-98cf65a56868" /></a> |
| **Minimal Abstraction 8Bit CPU**| I built a simple 8Bit CPU architecture out of single bit logic gates with little to no abstraction to get a big picture of how a basic computer can do stuff. More info in my [writeup](https://cb341.dev/projects/8bit-cpu/). I'd love to build this thingy irl some day.. | <a href="https://cb341.dev/projects/8bit-cpu/"> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cd717f4-5b8a-418e-87b7-46422664b624"> </a>     |
| **Basic 64 Byte RAM component** | I like having many tabs open. Was wondering how RAM works internally. I like to learn by doing so I have a naive (emulated) hardware impl. More info in my [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TuringComplete/comments/1mvqjvt/64bytes_of_ram_made_of_1bit_logic_gates/). | <img width="1080" height="859" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2125e7d5-8b27-4459-b08f-0fce7f4948fd" /> |
| **Hardware RMU (Ray Marching Unit) concept**     | Goal is to design hardware in an emulator that is optimized to perform ray marching on a set of primitives, making use of SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data). Not quite ready to show yet but it will be super cool!                                                                                                                           | <img width="1928" height="1922" alt="CleanShot 2025-09-02 at 23 51 39@2x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/619ee8da-58d5-4ee7-8027-f3d49fa9f99d" />     |
